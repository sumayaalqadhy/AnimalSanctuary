# Animal Sanctuary Project 

**Objective**

This is a short Kotlin project from Code Academy that helps us keep track of chimps we're caring for and our daily responsibilities. 

We’ll have Bonnie, Jubilee, Frodo, and Foxie: 4 young chimpanzees in our care. Foxie is the youngest of the group so she will require some extra attention.

Our program will ensure that during our shift we’ve…

- Fed all the chimps
- Played a random game with them
- Conducted a health check on Foxie
